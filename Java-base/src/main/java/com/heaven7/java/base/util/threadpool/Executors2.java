 * Factory and utility methods for {@link Executor}, {@link
 * ExecutorService}, {@link ScheduledExecutorService}, {@link
 * ThreadFactory}, and {@link Callable} classes defined in this
 * package. This class supports the following kinds of methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Methods that create and return an {@link ExecutorService}
 *        set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link ScheduledExecutorService}
 *        set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a "wrapped" ExecutorService, that
 *        disables reconfiguration by making implementation-specific methods
 *        inaccessible.
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link ThreadFactory}
 *        that sets newly created threads to a known state.
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link Callable}
 *        out of other closure-like forms, so they can be used
 *        in execution methods requiring {@code Callable}.
 * </ul>
